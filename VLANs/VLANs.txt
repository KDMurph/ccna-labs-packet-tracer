LAN- single broadcast domain

broadcast domain- group of device that will receive a broadcast frame from any one of the members

performance- lots of unnecessary broadcast traffic can reduce network performance

a switch will not forward traffic between VLANs including broadcast/unknown unicast traffic

a switch does not perform inter-VLAN routing, it must go through the router

vlan 1 is default 

an access port is a switchport that belongs to a single VLAN and usually connects to end hosts

trunk port - switchports that carry multiple VLANs

commands:

show vlan brief
int or int range
SW1(config-if)#switchport mode access
switchport access vlan #
vlan #
name
